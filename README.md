# BoringWebSocketPackage
## 0.1.0

* Basic PHP WAMP V2 WebSocket project using the library: [Thruway](https://github.com/voryx/Thruway).
* Modified for public display.
* Repository contains 3 components: A 'router' that manages WebSocket connections, a 'notifier client' that pushes messages to a topic and a 'listener client' that subscribes to a topic.

## Notes

* Repository exists for demonstration purposes only. Use at your own risk.
* Run `router.php` directly rather than through a web server.
* Apache + certain modules allows WSS.
